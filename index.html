    <h1>MEET YOU ENGLISH TEACHER</h1>
   <h3> EUDIN CUEVA</h3>
   <p>Hello, my name's EUDIN,
    And I'm here to make the choice;
    the choice to help others become the best version of themselves,
    the happiest version of themselves,
    the most elevated version of themselves.
    As an English coach,
    I go beyond the English language,
    I go beyond what students need to know,
    I take them to where they want to be.
    By combining what I know to overcome my students:
    problems with confidence,
    problems of clarity,
    problems with communication.
    When we learn to communicate effectively, in any language,
    we can solve any problem together,
    we can push each other to do more,
    we can make the world the one we want to live in.
    God gave birds the ability to fly.
    God gave fish the ability to swim.
    God gave us the ability to talk.
    Our superpower is ours to use,
    and the better we use it,
    the better we can live,
    in our professional and personal lives.
    So, I am here to make a difference.
    I have made a choice.
    My mission is to help new entrepreneurs,
    business orientated teachers,
    And future leaders,
    become master communicators.
    Let's embrace the opportunities and challenges we face.
    Let's get clear in our intentions and understandings of each other.
    Let's help save the world one conversation at a time.
    Help me make the difference.
    Make me the choice.
